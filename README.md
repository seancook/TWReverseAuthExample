#	ReverseAuthExample

##	Summary

This project illustrates how to use the Twitter API's reverse\_auth endpoint to obtain a user's access token and secret for your application's consumer key and secret.

The latest version of this project can be found at [github](https://github.com/seancook/TWReverseAuthExample).

### To use the demo:

1. First, take a look at ["Using Reverse Auth"](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/ios/using-reverse-auth) to understand how the process works.
2. Add your application's consumer key and secret to TWTViewController.m in `-initWithNibName:bundle:`.
3. Build and run. Click the button labeled "Perform Token Exchange" to execute the token exchange.
